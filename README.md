# Numworks games
This is a compilation of small games I made for the Numworks calculator. <br />
They were all designed to work on an N100 with Omega 2.0.6, but they (mostly) all run on other Numworks calculator, and on PC by installing the *kandinsky* and *ion-numworks* library to python.
This can be done using the following commands : ```pip install kandinsky``` and ```pip install ion-numworks``` <br />
I'll leave links to the Numworks website were my scripts are, to directly transfer them to a calculator, or view the changelogs (if there is one). <br />
Also I must say, the code is far from being polished and has very few comments. It was only made for fun in a small time.

## Dodge the Squares

This is the first one I made. The code is on a new level a bad, although I made a *slightly* better version with v2. <br />

## Numworks Zombies

Inspired by Call of Duty's zombies game mode, you just shoot zombies, they get stronger over time, you get points that can buy an upgrade (with 5k, walk over the blue rectangle), then they're only used to flex. <br />

## Square Cannon

This one might be considered finished, you shoot a square with a square to shoot the other square. Very philosophical. <br />
It uses real-life physics for the projectile trajectory, and for the wind, it uses whatever I tried that works and looks good. <br />

## Pokeworse

Definitely the most impressive. It can render a full screen in a few seconds (instantly on PC, when changing the OS settings to PC). <br />
Although it has no gameplay, it still is a nice tech demo, it is very easy to create a map and change its position on the grid. <br />
The program also includes a bicolor sprite renderer (the Numworks can only draw rectangles), and like the map/grid, they just need a list of strings.
It could fairly easily be improved to include more colors, but given the hardware limitations, it's not worth it. <br />
You need all 3 files to run it, and it might not work on some Numworks (I don't know if it is because of hardware or OS). <br />
This one has no Numworks page, because having 3 different files is just very annoying.
